# Getting Started with serverlessrepo
 
This project was configured with Azure for [serverless microservices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-za/azure/azure-functions/?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace)
 
## Compile Your Code
If your function requires compilation (e.g., C# or TypeScript), compile it using the appropriate compiler. For example:
For TypeScript:
 
### `tsc index.ts`
 
## Local Testing
Azure Functions Core Tools allow you to test your functions locally before deploying them to the cloud. Run the following command to start the Azure Functions runtime locally:
 
### `func start`
 
Test Your Function: Once the runtime is started, you can test your function locally by sending requests to the specified endpoint. Use tools like cURL or Postman to trigger your function and validate its functionality.
 
## Implement Your Functionality
Dive into the code and implement your desired functionality. Azure Functions support various programming languages including Python, C#, JavaScript, etc. Modify the code to suit your requirements.
 
## Azure Account Setup
If you haven't already, sign up for an Azure account. You'll need this to deploy your function to the cloud.
 
## Deploy Your Function
Use Azure CLI, Visual Studio Code, or the Azure portal to deploy your function to Azure. Follow the deployment guide provided by Azure for your chosen deployment method.
 
## Integration
Explore integrating your Azure Function with other Azure services such as Azure Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Service Bus, etc., to create powerful serverless applications.
